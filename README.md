Hi, my name is Jillo Abdullahi. 

I am passionate about coding (which of course explains why I am here in the first place), getting to know different people, learning new things  and it gives me a massive deal of satisfaction whenever I create or try to create something new.

I am also a tech enthusiast in love with all things from smartphones (I like to stick to stock android and iOS) to boosted boards. MKBHD, Casey Neistat and Unbox Therapy make up some of my favorite youtubers.
